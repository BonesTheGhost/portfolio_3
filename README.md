Portfolio 3

The expectations for this particular update, as opposed to portfolio homeworks in the past, is to simply polish my page for the hopes of networking with companies. I originally attempted to make this page delightfully uncomplicated. I think I may have missed a few key details from the last time around, namely a profile picture.

I will attempt to add those key pieces with this update!

==========
Additions:
==========

1. Added a profile picture on the very first 'bio' tab.

2. Added an additional text box under the profile picture and 'about me' section highlighting the technology and design experience that I have.
2. b. Updated the information for the 'about me' section.
2. c. Updated the information for the 'highlights' section.

3. Added an entire fourth tab for my resume.
4. Removed more personal information like my phone number since this will be visible on the internet.
5. Inserted, formatted, and styled resume content within the context of my site's overall color theme (or at least attempted to...).

6. Removed the previvous portfolio2 repository to protect my more personal information (i.e. phone number) and make sure that this is the most up-to-date portfolio available.
